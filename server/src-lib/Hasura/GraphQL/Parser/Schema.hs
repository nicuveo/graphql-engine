{- Note [The 'Both kind]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As described in the Haddock comments for Kind and <:, we use Kind to index
various types, such as Type and Parser. We use this to enforce various
correctness constraints mandated by the GraphQL spec; for example, we don’t
allow input object fields to have output types and we don’t allow output object
fields to have input types.

But scalars and enums can be used as input types *or* output types. A natural
encoding of that in Haskell would be to make constructors for those types
polymorphic, like this:

    data Kind = Input | Output

    data TypeInfo k where
      TIScalar      :: TypeInfo k           -- \ Polymorphic!
      TIEnum        :: ... -> TypeInfo k    -- /
      TIInputObject :: ... -> TypeInfo 'Input
      TIObject      :: ... -> TypeInfo 'Output

Naturally, this would give the `scalar` parser constructor a similarly
polymorphic type:

    scalar
      :: MonadParse m
      => Name
      -> Maybe Description
      -> ScalarRepresentation a
      -> Parser k m a             -- Polymorphic!

But if we actually try that, we run into problems. The trouble is that we want
to use the Kind to influence several different things:

  * As mentioned above, we use it to ensure that the types we generate are
    well-kinded according to the GraphQL spec rules.

  * We use it to determine what a Parser consumes as input. Parsers for input
    types parse GraphQL input values, but Parsers for output types parse
    selection sets. (See Note [The meaning of Parser 'Output] in
    Hasura.GraphQL.Parser.Internal.Parser for an explanation of why.)

  * We use it to know when to expect a sub-selection set for a field of an
    output object (see Note [The delicate balance of GraphQL kinds]).

These many uses of Kind cause some trouble for a polymorphic representation. For
example, consider our `scalar` parser constructor above---if we were to
instantiate it at kind 'Output, we’d receive a `Parser 'Output`, which we would
then expect to be able to apply to a selection set. But that doesn’t make any
sense, since scalar fields don’t have selection sets!

Another issue with this representation has to do with effectful parser
constructors (such as constructors that can throw errors). These have types like

    mkFooParser :: MonadSchema n m => Blah -> m (Parser k n Foo)

where the parser construction is itself monadic. This causes some annoyance,
since even if mkFooParser returns a Parser of a polymorphic kind, code like this
will not typecheck:

    (fooParser :: forall k. Parser k n Foo) <- mkFooParser blah

The issue is that we have to instantiate k to a particular type to be able to
call mkFooParser. If we want to use the result at both kinds, we’d have to call
mkFooParser twice:

    (fooInputParser :: Parser 'Input n Foo) <- mkFooParser blah
    (fooOutputParser :: Parser 'Output n Foo) <- mkFooParser blah

Other situations encounter similar difficulties, and they are not easy to
resolve without impredicative polymorphism (which GHC does not support).

To avoid this problem, we don’t use polymorphic kinds, but instead introduce a
form of kind subsumption. Types that can be used as both input and output types
are explicitly given the kind 'Both. This allows us to get the best of both
worlds:

  * We use the <: typeclass to accept 'Both in most places where we expect
    either input or output types.

  * We can treat 'Both specially to avoid requiring `scalar` to supply a
    selection set parser (see Note [The delicate balance of GraphQL kinds] for
    further explanation).

  * Because we avoid the polymorphism, we don’t run into the aforementioned
    issue with monadic parser constructors.

All of this is subtle and somewhat complicated, but unfortunately there isn’t
much of a way around that: GraphQL is subtle and complicated. Our use of an
explicit 'Both kind isn’t the only way to encode these things, but it’s the
particular set of compromises we’ve chosen to accept.

Note [The delicate balance of GraphQL kinds]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As discussed in Note [The 'Both kind], we use GraphQL kinds to distinguish
several different things. One of them is which output types take sub-selection
sets. For example, scalars don’t accept sub-selection sets, so if we have a
schema like

    type Query {
      users: [User!]!
    }

    type User {
      id: Int!
    }

then the following query is illegal:

    query {
      users {
        id {
          blah
        }
      }
    }

The id field has a scalar type, so it should not take a sub-selection set. This
is actually something we care about distinguishing at the type level, because it
affects the type of the `selection` parser combinator. Suppose we have a
`Parser 'Output m UserQuery` for the User type. When we parse a field with that
type, we expect to receive a UserQuery as a result, unsurprisingly. But what if
we parse an output field using the `int` parser, which has this type:

    int :: MonadParse m => Parser 'Both m Int32

If we follow the same logic as for the User parser above, we’d expect to receive
an Int32 as a result... but that doesn’t make any sense, since the Int32
corresponds to the result *we* are suppose to produce as a result of executing
the query, not something user-specified.

One way to solve this would be to associate every Parser with two result types:
one when given an input object, and one when given a selection set. Then our
parsers could be given these types, instead:

    user :: MonadParse m => Parser 'Output m Void UserQuery
    int :: MonadParse m => Parser 'Both m Int32 ()

But if you work through this, you’ll find that *all* parsers will either have
Void or () for at least one of their input result types or their output result
types, depending on their kind:

  * All 'Input parsers must have Void for their output result type, since they
    aren’t allowed to be used in output contexts at all.

  * All 'Output parsers must have Void for their input result type, since they
    aren’t allowed to be used in input contexts at all.

  * That just leaves 'Both. The only types of kind 'Both are scalars and enums,
    neither of which accept a sub-selection set. Their output result type would
    therefore be (), since they are allowed to appear in output contexts, but
    they don’t return any results.

The end result of this is that we clutter all our types with Voids and ()s, with
little actual benefit.

If you really think about it, the fact that the no types of kind 'Both accept a
sub-selection set is really something of a coincidence. In theory, one could
imagine a future version of the GraphQL spec adding a type that can be used as
both an input type or an output type, but accepts a sub-selection set. If that
ever happens, we’ll have to tweak our encoding, but for now, we can take
advantage of this happy coincidence and make the kinds serve double duty:

  * We can make `ParserInput 'Both` identical to `ParserInput 'Input`, since
    all parsers of kind 'Both only parse input values.

  * We can require types of kind 'Both in `selection`, which does not expect a
    sub-selection set, and types of kind 'Output in `subselection`, which does.

Relying on this coincidence might seem a little gross, and perhaps it is
somewhat. But it’s enormously convenient: not doing this would make some types
significantly more complicated, since we would have to thread around more
information at the type level and we couldn’t make as many simplifying
assumptions. So until GraphQL adds a type that violates these assumptions, we
are happy to take advantage of this coincidence. -}
